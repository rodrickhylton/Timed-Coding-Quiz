# Timed-Coding-Quiz
This is an application uses Javascript mainly to create a Coding Quiz following certain guidelines. 

## Description 
This is an appliaction that is meant to take the user on a quiz journey about Javasrcipt. I tried to make this application to give the user questions and options for answers all revolving around javascript while being timed. If the user gets a question wrong then I wanted the application to deduct 10 seconds from the timer until the game ends. I also wanted the game to end when the timer went out and for the score to appear as well.
